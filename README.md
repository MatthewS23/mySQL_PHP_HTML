# Overview
The	company	"Incredibly	Reliable	Scooters"	rents	electric	scooters	to	
customers	over	a	mobile	application.	The	scooters	are	available	to	rent	
around	the	city	to	be	activated	at	the	location	by	the	customer.	The	
scooters	are	tracked	by	GPS	.	In	order	to	recharge	the	scooters	employees	
are	hired	through	the	application	as	"Rechargers."	A	"Rechargers"	
responsibility	is	to	retrieve	the	scooter,	recharge	the	scooter's	batteries,	
perform	maintenance	on	the	scooter,	and	then	place	the	scooter	at	the	
designated	location	on	the	application.				
Goals:	
	 Incredibly	Reliable	Scooters	is	creating	a	database	in	order	to	keep	
track	of	information	in	order	to	make	informed	business	decisions.	These	
decisions	are	motivated	to	better	understand	how	to	avoid	risks	to	
customer,	a	reliable	understanding	of	their	inventory,	and	a	growing	
knowledge	of	how	the	scooters	are	being	used.		
Capabilities:	
	 The	database	must	keep	track	of	customers,	the	customers	payment	
method,	the	companyâ€™s	payment	method,	a	rental	of	a	scooter,	analytics	of	
a	rental	instance,	the	entirety	of	the	scooter	inventory,	analytics	on	each	
individual	scooter,	the	scooter	maintenance	history	of	each	scooter,	and	the	
Rechargers.		
Features:	
	 For	the	Analytics	of	a	Rental	Instance	Incredibly	Reliable	Scooters	
wants	to	keep	track	of	the	distance	traveled,	length	of	time	used,	and	the	
top	speed	achieved.		
	 For	the	Analytics	of	a	scooter	Incredibly	Reliable	Scooters	wants	to	
keep	track	of	the	battery	level,	current	GPS	location,	and	top	speed.	
									A	scooter	maintenance	history	record	is	created	upon	an	instance	of	a	
scooter	performing	his	recharging	and	maintenance	duties.	Within	the	
scooter	maintenance	history	record	the	company	would	like	to	keep	track	
if	a	mechanical	malfunction	happened,	if	the	scooter	was	involved	in	a	
wreck,	the	physical	state	of	the	battery,	and	a	description	of	the	
maintenance	performed.		
*in	deployment:	amount	of	time	the	scooter	was	rented	or	available	to	rent.	
Does	not	include	when	a	scooter	is	in	service(maintenance).
